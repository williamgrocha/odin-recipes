# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project’s Foundations Course and serves as my first practical introduction to building a basic website using only HTML. The goal is to create a simple recipe website containing a main index page and individual recipe pages.

By the time I complete this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:
- Structure a multi-page website using semantic HTML
- Use headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images correctly
- Organize files within a project directory
- Commit and push project files using Git

This project is a foundational step toward becoming comfortable with core web development tools and workflows.
